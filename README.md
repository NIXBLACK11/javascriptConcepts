JavaScript is inherently single-threaded and non-blocking, which means it has the appearance of being synchronous (one operation executing at a time) even when dealing with asynchronous operations. This can be somewhat confusing, so let's break it down:

- Single-Threaded: 
    JavaScript runs in a single execution thread within a web browser or a Node.js environment. This means that at any given moment, only one operation is executed, and the next operation has to wait until the current one finishes.

- Non-Blocking: 
    JavaScript uses an event loop to manage asynchronous operations. When an asynchronous operation (e.g., making an HTTP request, reading a file, or setting a timer) is initiated, JavaScript doesn't block the entire program's execution. Instead, it registers a callback function to be executed when the operation is complete. This allows other code to continue running while waiting for the asynchronous operation to finish.
